      Lying, thinking&nbsp;
      Last night&nbsp;
      How to find my soul a home&nbsp;
      Where water is not thirsty&nbsp;
      And bread loaf is not stone&nbsp;
      I came up with one thing&nbsp;
      And I don't believe I'm wrong&nbsp;
      That nobody,&nbsp;
      But nobody&nbsp;
      Can make it out here alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      There are some millionaires&nbsp;
      With money they can't use&nbsp;
      Their wives run round like banshees&nbsp;
      Their children sing the blues&nbsp;
      They've got expensive doctors&nbsp;
      To cure their hearts of stone.&nbsp;
      But nobody&nbsp;
      No, nobody&nbsp;
      Can make it out here alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Now if you listen closely&nbsp;
      I'll tell you what I know&nbsp;
      Storm clouds are gathering&nbsp;
      The wind is gonna blow&nbsp;
      The race of man is suffering&nbsp;
      And I can hear the moan,&nbsp;
      'Cause nobody,&nbsp;
