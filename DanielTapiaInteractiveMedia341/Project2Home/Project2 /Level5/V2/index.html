        Lying, thinking<br>
        Last night<br>
        How to find my soul a home<br>
        Where water is not thirsty<br>
        And bread loaf is not stone<br>
        I came up with one thing<br>
        And I don't believe I'm wrong<br>
        That nobody,<br>
        But nobody<br>
        Can make it out here alone.<br>

        <span class="chor":hover> Alone, all alone<br>
        Nobody, but nobody<br>
        Can make it out here alone.</span></div>

        There are some millionaires<br>
        With money they can't use<br>
        Their wives run round like banshees<br>
        Their children sing the blues<br>
        They've got expensive doctors<br>
        To cure their hearts of stone.<br>
        But nobody<br>
        No, nobody<br>
        Can make it out here alone<br>  

        <span class="chor"> Alone, all alone<br>
          Nobody, but nobody<br>
          Can make it out here alone.</span>
      </p>

        Now if you listen closely<br>
        I'll tell you what I know<br>
        Storm clouds are gathering<br>
        The wind is gonna blow<br>
        The race of man is suffering<br>
        And I can hear the moan,<br>
        'Cause nobody,<br>
        But nobody<br>
        Can make it out here alone.<br>
      
        <span class="chor"> Alone, all alone<br>
          Nobody, but nobody<br>
          Can make it out here alone.</span>
