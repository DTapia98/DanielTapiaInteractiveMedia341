    <h1>Alone</h1>

    <p>
      Lying, thinking <br />
      Last night<br />
      <br />
      How to find my soul a home<br />
      Where water is not thirsty<br />
      <br />
      And bread loaf is not stone<br />
      I came up with one thing<br />
      <br />
      And I don't believe I'm wrong<br/>
      <br />
      That nobody,<br/>
      <br />
      But nobody<br/>
      <br />
      Can make it out here alone.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>
        <br />
        <br />
        Alone,
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        all alone
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Nobody,
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        but nobody
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Can make it out here alone.<br />
    </p>
      <br />
      <br />
    <p>
      There are some millionaires<br />
      With money they can't use<br />
      <br />
      Their wives run round like banshees<br />
      Their children sing the blues<br />
      <br />
      They've got expensive doctors<br />
      To cure their hearts of stone.<br />
      <br />
      But nobody<br />
      <br />
      No, nobody<br />
      <br />
      Can make it out here alone.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
      <br />
      Alone,
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      all alone
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Nobody,
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      but nobody
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Can make it out here alone.<br />
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>
      Now if you listen closely<br />
      I'll tell you what I know<br />
      <br />
      Storm clouds are gathering<br />
      The wind is gonna blow<br />
      <br />
      The race of man is suffering<br />
      And I can hear the moan,<br />
      <br />
      'Cause nobody,<br />
      <br />
      But nobody<br />
      <br />
      Can make it out here alone.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
      <br />
      Alone,
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      all alone
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Nobody,
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      but nobody
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Can make it out here alone.<br />
    </p>
