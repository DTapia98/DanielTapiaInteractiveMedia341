     <h1>Play Profound Response</h1>
     <h2>Daniel Tapia</h2>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The article by Susan Rethorst was not an easy read and required me to read certain parts more than once to grasp the concepts being discussed. It did spark some thoughts about my own creative process and process of doing things in general. The article talks about the importance of freeing ourselves from our restrictive ideas of how something is created or made.
     Rethorst talks about how the transformative way she learned to created dances is almost identical to the way she would create dances when she was very young and because of that created dances that were new to her or built on each other from different starting points. This resonated a lot with me because it reminded me of my own personal experiences with creativity in soccer which I’ve played for as long as I can remember. 
     I loved it so much when I was younger in comparison to my teenage years. When I was younger I had a lot of freedom to do whatever I wanted to do with the ball with little instruction from coaches. I was a stand-out player then. When I got older and started playing competitively I felt that freedom stripped away from me. Everything seemed very rigid and yes rigorous. Coaches would yell at me if I dribbled too much or got out of position or made the wrong decision. 
     It was a complete change and something that took a little for me to get adjusted to. I was no longer the star of the team as I had been before and felt like it wasn’t as fun at first. Once I learned how to work within those restrictions though, I began to enjoy it again and loved seeing the progress I would make over time. Throughout those years I would have different coaches and some would let me play more freely whereas others were very strict on what they wanted me to do.
     I felt that I always played my best when I was given a little freedom which allowed me to enjoy the game more and in turn made me play better. I was working extremely hard but I was enjoying myself while doing so and it showed on the field. When I wasn't enjoying myself, my play suffered and so did my drive. Switching over to my creative process, I think a lot of it has been shaped by school, and again everything seemed very rigid and like there was a process you had to follow to make good work.  
     Only recently have I begun to feel like I have more freedom in my projects and be able to create works that I enjoy. It has caused some questions of identity and if I’m really even creative at all and going down the right path. A lot of times I remember myself being miserable working on a project and having second thoughts about design school because I wasn’t having any fun. There was very little pleasure to be found (sometimes none) and that has to be one of the worst feelings in my opinion. 
     If we can’t find any pleasure in what we’re doing why even do it all? I’ve learned to find pleasure in the process of making something and being able to look back at it and know the work and ideas that went into it. My mentality is now that I will create my best work once I’m out of school and only work on projects that resonate with me and align with my interests and values. Obviously, not everything I do in life will bring me pleasure. 
     But I do think that as long as it’s for something that means a lot to me or makes me happy, I’ll be able to find even a little pleasure in it.
