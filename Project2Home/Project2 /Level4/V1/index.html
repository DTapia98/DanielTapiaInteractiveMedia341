            Lying, thinking
            Last night
            How to find my soul a home
            Where water is not thirsty
            And bread loaf is not stone
            I came up with one thing
            And I don't believe I'm wrong
            That nobody,
            But nobody
            Can make it out here alone.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Alone, all alone
            Nobody, but nobody
            Can make it out here alone.

              There are some millionaires
              With money they can't use
              Their wives run round like banshees
              Their children sing the blues
              They've got expensive doctors
              To cure their hearts of stone.
              But nobody
              No, nobody
              Can make it out here alone.<br>

            Now if you listen closely
            I'll tell you what I know
            Storm clouds are gathering
            The wind is gonna blow
            The race of man is suffering
            And I can hear the moan,
            'Cause nobody,
            But nobody
            Can make it out here alone.<br>
            <br>

            Alone, all alone
            Nobody, but nobody
            Can make it out here alone.
