    <h1>ALONE</h1>
      <p>
        Lying, thinking<br>
        Last night<br>
        How to find my soul a home<br>
        Where water is not thirsty<br>
        And bread loaf is not stone<br>
        I came up with one thing<br>
        And I don't believe I'm wrong<br>
        That <span class="hi":hover>nobody,</span><br>
        But <span class="hi":hover>nobody</span><br>
        Can make it out here alone.<br>

        Alone, all alone<br>
        <span class="hi":hover>Nobody,</span> but <span class="hi":hover>nobody</span><br>
        Can make it out here alone.
      </p>

      <p class="a">
        There are some millionaires<br>
        With money they can't use<br>
        Their wives run round like banshees<br>
        Their children sing the blues<br>
        They've got expensive doctors<br>
        To cure their hearts of stone.<br>
        But <span class="hi":hover>nobody</span><br>
        No, <span class="hi":hover>nobody</span><br>
        Can make it out here alone<br>

        Alone, all alone<br>
        <span class="hi":hover>Nobody,</span> but <span class="hi":hover>nobody</span><br>
        Can make it out here alone.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now if you listen closely<br>
        I'll tell you what I know<br>
        Storm clouds are gathering<br>
        The wind is gonna blow<br>
        The race of man is suffering<br>
        And I can hear the moan,<br>
        'Cause <span class="hi":hover>nobody,</span><br>
        But <span class="hi":hover>nobody</span><br>
        Can make it out here alone.<br>
      
        Alone, all alone<br>
        <span class="hi":hover>Nobody,</span> but <span class="hi":hover>nobody</span><br>
        Can make it out here alone.
